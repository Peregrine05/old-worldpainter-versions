<!-- Attach the WorldPainter installers and archives that you have saved to this issue. If you have more than one installer or archive, or if GitHub refuses to upload the file based on its file extension, then it is recommended to pack the installer(s) and/or archive(s) into a ZIP file and then upload that ZIP file. -->
